## Regression

Regression is basically a statistical approach to find the relationship between variables. In machine learning, this is used to predict the outcome of an event based on the relationship between variables obtained from the data-set. Linear regression is one type regression used in Machine Learning.

## Types of Regression

1) Simple Linear Regression
2) Polynomial Regression
3) Support Vector Regression
4) Decision Tree Regression
5) Random Forest Regression


### Linear Regression
Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning. It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables. It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting. Different regression models differ based on â€“ the kind of relationship between dependent and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.

Linear regression performs the task to predict a dependent variable value (y) based on a given independent variable (x). So, this regression technique finds out a linear relationship between x (input) and y(output). Hence, the name is Linear Regression.

## Multiple Linear Regression
In the previous topic, we have learned about Simple Linear Regression, where a single Independent/Predictor(X) variable is used to model the response variable (Y). But there may be various cases in which the response variable is affected by more than one predictor variable; for such cases, the Multiple Linear Regression algorithm is used.

Moreover, Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of Simple Linear regression as it takes more than one predictor variable to predict the response variable. We can define it as:

## Polynomial Regression
Polynomial regression, like linear regression, uses the relationship between the variables x and y to find the best way to draw a line through the data points. The Polynomial Regression equation is given below:

    y= b0+b1x1+ b2x12+ b2x13+...... bnx1n
    
- It is also called the special case of Multiple Linear Regression in ML. Because we add some polynomial terms to the Multiple Linear regression equation to convert it into Polynomial Regression.
- It is a linear model with some modification in order to increase the accuracy.
- The dataset used in Polynomial regression for training is of non-linear nature.
- It makes use of a linear regression model to fit the complicated and non-linear functions and datasets.
- Hence, "In Polynomial regression, the original features are converted into Polynomial features of required degree (2,3,..,n) and then modeled using a linear model.
